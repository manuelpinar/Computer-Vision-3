The purpose of this practice is to recover the 3D shape of an object a
From the information contained in a set of images captured with a
CCD camera and laser marker.
The structure that was used to obtain the set of images is shown in the
Figure 1 (Camera Position.png). Note that a camera has been set in a fixed and oriented position
towards the scene.

On the other hand, the laser marker can make two types of movements:
• Vertical: the parameter 'd' (angles table) indicates the separation between the laser and the center of the
flat image of the camera.
• Horizontal: the laser can move angularly around a vertical axis.
We have called the angular parameter β (angles table).
